Although we had survived the attack, I thought it best to withdraw towards Tenochtitlan, and share with Emperor Montezuma all that we had learned."     12 9 4

The Spanish had evidently never seen anything like Tenochtitlan, and they stared in wonder at the brightly colored markets and pyramids rising out of a man-made island in the middle of gigantic Lake Texcoco."     12 9 4

But Cortéz was mostly interested in gold ornaments, and helped himself to any which he encountered.  I was no longer convinced that this man was Quetzalcoatl.  So says Cuauhtemoc, Jaguar Warrior of Tenochtitlan."     12 9 4
