Before his army and his court, a nervous Alfonso did make this declaration.  In so doing, the Cid helped to cement Alfonso’s claim as King in the hearts of the people, for they so trusted the Cid."     0   0   0

Instead, Alfonso held a grudge against the man who was the greatest of his knights for ever doubting him.  Alfonso also was jealous and suspicious of the Cid’s popularity with the soldiers and the common man.  He sent the Cid into dangerous battle again and again, but always the Cid emerged victorious."     0   0   0
