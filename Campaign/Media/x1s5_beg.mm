2   TEXT  415  220  280   250    05387     27969        3     "The battle between Hun and Roman was fought at the end of June, 451.  The Romans were commanded by Aetius, a brilliant and celebrated general who had been held hostage by Attila when he was a boy.  Aetius knew Attila and knew the Hunnic ways.  Since he had returned to the Western Empire, Aetius had done more than any man to keep Rome alive throughout the period of barbarian invasions."     12  9  4

Even though these dubious allies had a common hatred of the Huns, it was still a remarkable achievement on Aetius' part to have drawn them into an effective military relationship."     12  9  4

Attila’s shamans looked at the entrails of cattle and the color of sheep bones, and prophesized that the Huns would meet defeat on the Catalaunian fields.  However, they also foresaw that the commander of the opposing force would be killed."     12  9  4

8   TEXT  160  200  250   200    82012     25705        3     "Before blood was drawn, Attila stood before his assembled troops clutching the sword of Mars in his fist.  He told them, ‘It is a right of nature to glut the soul with vengeance.  I shall hurl the first spear at the foe.  If any man can stand at rest while Attila fights, he is a dead man.’"     12  9  4
