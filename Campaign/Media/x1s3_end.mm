The amenities of his ‘office’ meant nothing to him.  While his chieftains and council ate off of silver plates, Attila’s own plate and goblet were hewn from simple wood.  His Scythian guards had jewels on their sword hilts and their cloaks were clasped with gold, but Attila showed no such affectations."     0   0   0

All of the barbarians wanted to possess Rome, as if it would buy them instant legitimacy as a world-spanning Empire.  Unlike most of the other barbarians, however, Attila was actually going to get his chance."     0   0   0
