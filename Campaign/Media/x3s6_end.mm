It is difficult to recall that this smoking ruin was once an endless city.  Yet, we will rebuild.  We created this island upon which our city and temples stand, and we can do it once more."     12 9 4

I am not certain there is a place for us in this new world.  I could ask the gods for a hint of the future, but no doubt that would lead to more sacrifice and I think there has been enough death for now.  My people composed a poem to commemorate this great war that we have survived, and yet perhaps still not won:"     12 9 4
