The stream was turned to a torrent by the rushing of blood.  I pity those that were forced to slake their thirst from it.  ‘Cadavera vero innumera’, the Romans said afterwards.  ‘Truly countless bodies.’  Perhaps 300,000 men were left dead on the Catalaunian fields.  It is said the ghosts of those killed continued to fight for several days."         0   0   0

When he found me, huddled beneath my shield, I made my peace with God.  But Attila did not seek my decapitation.  He saw that I was a holy man, and ordered me to join his retinue of foreign advisors.  ‘That is how you know so much of the Huns,’ I offered."         0   0   0

Attila had lost much of his cavalry, but the Romans' entire army was destroyed.  For a time, no one knew if the Hun king would continue to pursue the hand of Honoria.  ‘But what of the prophecy?’  I asked.  ‘Did Aetius die on the battlefield?’"         0   0   0

Aetius knew that if he utterly destroyed the Huns, then the Visigoths would have no need for a Roman alliance and Rome would face yet another barbarian threat."         0   0   0
