2   TEXT  360  200  300   400    12137     25461        4     "The ancient priest stared out the window for a long time, recalling days gone by.  'I was there,' he said finally.  'At the battle of the Catalaunian Fields…fighting alongside Aetius and Theodoric the Goth.'  I knew there had been a battle here, decades ago.

They were terrifying warriors from the steppes of Asia, their bodies disfigured from ritual scarring, their legs deformed from a near lifetime in the saddle."  12  9  4

He called himself the Scourge of God.  Attila and his brother Bleda led the Huns not just to raid, but to devastate Scythia and Persia." 12  9  4
